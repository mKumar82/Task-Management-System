Task Management System (Full Stack)

A full-stack Task Management System built as part of a software engineering assessment.
The project includes a secure backend API built with Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Prisma, and PostgreSQL, and a responsive web frontend built with Next.js (App Router) and TypeScript.

POST	/tasks	Create a new task
GET	/tasks/:id	Get a task by ID
PATCH	/tasks/:id	Update a task
DELETE	/tasks/:id	Delete a task
POST	/tasks/:id/toggle	Toggle task status


⸻

🖥 Frontend Features

⚙️ Environment Variables

Backend (.env)

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<db>
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_secret
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=your_refresh_secret

Frontend (.env.local)

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://task-management-system-svk7.vercel.app

🛠 Backend Setup (Local)

cd backend
npm install
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run dev


⸻

🛠 Frontend Setup (Local)

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev


⸻

🌐 Deployment Notes
	•	Backend runs as a Vercel Serverless Function
	•	Prisma Client is generated using postinstall to avoid Vercel caching issues
	•	CORS is explicitly configured to allow frontend domain and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
	•	Tokens are sent via Authorization: Bearer <token> headers

⸻

📌 Key Design Decisions
	•	JWT-based stateless authentication
	•	Prisma ORM for type-safe database access
	•	Centralized API handling via apiFetch
	•	Clear HTTP status codes (400, 401, 404, 500)
	•	Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
